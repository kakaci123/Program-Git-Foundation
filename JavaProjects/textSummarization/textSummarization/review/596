When we checked in we were offered a choice of free drink and snack to take to the room and given free drinks vouchers for the bar. The room was huge with a small kitchenette, seating area and huge bed. Breakfast in the hotel was varied and plentiful, being able to make your own waffles was a great touch. Hot drinks are available free of charge all day and when the bar opens they have a very good drinks available.  The pool was really nice, warm, quiet and the hot tub finished it off nicely. The hotel is well located which is a great place for shopping. This was a fantastic hotel with great staff and everything you could ask for.
