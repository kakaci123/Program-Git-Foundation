We were very enjoyable in the hotel, all the staff we met were quite pleasant and helpful. We enjoyed the welcome free drinks, and the complimentary breakfast was fabulous - more than enough hot and cold choices. Our room was clean, quiet and comfortable, lots of toiletries, and there was a good size room. Definitely first class facilities and service all the way.
